		Welcome to your contracted position as an on-line therapy help line attendant.
		Your job is to help our users with therapy related questions through text conversation over the inter-net.
		And if you casually point them towards <b>Mirage Mental Health Services On-Line Therapy</b> you get a tidy bonus to your contracted rate.

		You Are Eliza was part of Otter Jam 2023, with the theme: Virtual Beasts.
		Submissions to the jam were required to include AI technology in the process of
		development, or AI as a theme of the game. You Are Eliza technically has both.
		<br><br>
		You play as a worker for an on-line therapy provider, answering user's questions
		and attempting to direct them toward's your employer's services. The users you are
		interacting with are powered by a modified version of ELIZA. One of the first ever
		chatbot AIs, originally developed in 1966.

<hr class="breaker">
<p>This was a solo project for Otterjam 2023, a week long game jam for Californa State University: Monterey Bay students. The theme was "virtual beasts." Submissions had to use AI or integrate AI into the story of the game.
	This game does both, using ELIZA for the AI of the clients the player is communicating with, and the parallels to how AI works today.
</p><br>
<h4>Using ELIZA</h4><br>
<p>
	The gameplay of You are Eliza involves convincing clients to choose the online therapy service you work for. These 'clients' are powered by a modified
	version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ELIZA</a>, an early chatbot from 1966.
	
	I am using a .NET conversion of ELIZA by Kris Craig which integrates well with Unity. ELIZA relies on a script file to decide how to respond, which in this case is a JSON file
	using regex. That file was heavily modified to turn ELIZA from the therapist into the therapy patient.
